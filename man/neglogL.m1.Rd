\title{Negative Log-Likelihood Function for 1D OUSSM}
\usage{
neglogL.m1(para, p.dim, N, ytn, tn.diff)
}
\arguments{
\item{para}{A numeric vector containing model parameters.}

\item{p.dim}{An integer specifying the number of observed variables.}

\item{N}{An integer specifying the total number of time points.}

\item{ytn}{A matrix of observed data with dimensions \code{(N, p.dim)}.}

\item{tn.diff}{A numeric vector representing the time gaps between observations.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the negative log-likelihood of the model.
}
\description{
This function computes the negative log-likelihood for a one-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck State-Space Model (OUSSM).
}
\details{
The function follows these steps:
\itemize{
\item Extracts and structures model parameters from \code{para}.
\item Constructs the transition and noise matrices for the state-space model.
\item Runs the Kalman filter to estimate the likelihood based on observed data.
\item Computes the negative log-likelihood by summing the prediction errors over time.
}

\examples{
# Example usage (assuming required parameters and data are predefined)
result <- neglogL.m1(para, p.dim, N, ytn, tn.diff)
